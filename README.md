# Introduction

Updates that may improve an AI system’s accuracy can also introduce new
and unanticipated errors that damage user trust. Updates that introduce
new errors can also break trust between software components and machine
learning models, as these errors are propagated and compounded
throughout larger integrated AI systems. The Backward Compatibility ML
library is an open-source project for evaluating AI system updates in a
new way for increasing system reliability and human trust in AI
predictions for actions.

The Backward Compatibility ML project has two components:

- **A series of loss functions** in which users can vary the weight
  assigned to the dissonance factor and explore performance/capability
  tradeoffs during machine learning optimization.

- **Visualization widgets** that help users examine metrics and error
  data in detail. They provide a view of error intersections between
  models and incompatibility distribution across classes.

# Getting Started

1. Setup a Python virtual environment or Conda environment and activate it.
2. From within the root folder of this project do `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. From within the root folder do `npm install`
4. From within the root folder of this project do `npm run build && pip install -e .` or `NODE_ENV=production npx webpack && pip install -e .`
5. You should now be able to import the `backwardcompatibilityml` module and use it.

# Examples

Start your Jupyter Notebooks server and load in the example notebook under the `examples` folder
to see how the `backwardcompatibilityml` module is used.

To demo the widget, open the notebook `compatibility-analysis.ipynb`.

# Tests

To run tests, make sure that you are in the project root folder and do:

1. `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
2. `pytest tests/`

# Development environment

To run the widget and APIs in a development environment:
- Open a new terminal, then from within the root folder do `npm start`. This will host the widget with `webpack-dev-server`.
  - To customize the host IP, run `webpack-dev-server --hot --mode development --host <ip>` instead of `npm start`.
  - `npm start` uses `0.0.0.0` which makes the server accessible externally.
- Open a new terminal, then from within the root folder do `flask run`. This will start the Flask server for the APIs used by the widget.

The widget can be loaded in the web browser at `localhost:3000`. It will be loaded independently from a Jupyter notebook. The APIs will be hosted at `localhost:5000`. If you are running the server within a VM, you might need to use your machine's local IP instead of `localhost`.

Changes to the CSS or TypeScript code will be hot loaded automatically in the browser. Flask will run in debug mode and automatically restart whenever the Python code is changed.
